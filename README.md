# B2B_AI
A Python-Flask website for iVisions-GmbH

This website links skype account contacts and conversations using SkPy library.
The user needs to login with Skype credentials and if the credentials are correct then it will auto-fetch the conversations every 40 mins.
The main agenda of this website is to classify text (vendor/client) based on the conversations and the text will be seggregated to respective vendor/client deals.
I have used N-gram technique as a pivot version, and this can be extended to unsupervised learning in the future.
