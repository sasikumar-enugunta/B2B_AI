# B2B_AI
A Python-Flask website for iVisions-GmbH

This website uses the SkPy library to link contacts and conversations between Skype accounts.
Once the user logs in with their Skype credentials, the conversations will be automatically retrieved every forty minutes if the credentials are valid.
This website's primary goal is to categorize text (vendor/client) according to the conversations, with the text then being divided into the appropriate vendor/client deals.
The N-gram approach, which I have employed as a pivot version, can eventually be expanded to unsupervised learning.
